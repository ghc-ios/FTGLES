A Haskell binding for the portable TrueType to OpenGL font rendering library FTGLES,
which is an iOS port of FTGL. This package is a slight modification by Stephen
Blackheath of J. R. Heard's Haskell binding package, FTGL.
This package provides OpenGL with polygonal, and texture mapped fonts using
Freetype2 and any truetype font.

See the .cabal file for installation instructions.
